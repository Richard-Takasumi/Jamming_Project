# Getting Started with Create React App

This is a front-end project which makes calls to the Spotify API, using the website you can create playlists extremely quickly and export them to your own spotify account. 

## Due to the limitations of the Spotify API, the application can not be accessed without the user being explicitly whitelisted to the created Spotify Developer App. Therefore I have instead linked a video to showcase how the project works.
